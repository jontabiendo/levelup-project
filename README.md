# levelUp Project

Introduction:

levelUp is a retro-aracade-style task management web-application designed to help individuals and teams organized on projects and tasks they need to complete. On levelUp, users can create multiple lists to keep track of different kinds of tasks. When viewing each lists, users can add new tasks to the list, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as complete or delete them. Tasks can be filtered by whether or not it's complete, allowing users to keep track of tasks they have already done and have yet to do.
